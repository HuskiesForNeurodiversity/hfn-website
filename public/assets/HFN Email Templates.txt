Finding a Therapist:
Subject Line: Openings for New Clients

Hi [Name],

My name is [name], and I’m currently looking for a therapist for help with [1-2 specific issues]. I have insurance via [insurance provider]. Do you currently have any openings for new clients, and if so would you be willing to set up a short phone consult? If not, do you have any referrals for local therapists who might be a good fit?

Thank you,
[Your name]

NOTE: If you do not have insurance or if you know this provider does not take your insurance, you can ask if they have sliding scale options instead. This typically means the fee they charge you will be based on your income level.

Emailing a Professor or TA for an extension:
Subject Line: Extension on [Assignment]?

Dear Professor [Name],

This is [name] from your [course] class. I’m behind on schoolwork this week and am concerned I will not be able to complete [assignment] by the deadline. Would it be possible for me to have an extension? I think I can get it done by [day and time]. Thank you and see you in class.

Sincerely,
[Your name]

NOTE: You can give the details of your situation (e.g. health issues, family emergency) if you want, but you are not obligated to tell instructors anything private. It is best to ask for an extension as soon as you think you might need one (usually a few days before the deadline). Try to avoid asking for extensions less than 24 hours before an assignment is due. Also, keep in mind that many professors will not check their email outside of work hours.

Asking for Informal Accommodations:
Subject Line: Course Access?

Dear Professor [Name],

This is [name] from your [course] class. I wanted to let you know I [am disabled/have had health issues recently] and it has been affecting my academics. In particular, I’ve been struggling with [examples]. [I am working on getting formal accommodations but they will take several months to implement/I am not able to access DRS accommodations because of xyz.] Could we meet to discuss alternative options so I can better engage with your course?
‍
Sincerely,
[Your name]

NOTE: Professors are not obligated to grant accommodation requests informally, but you can still ask. They are more likely to say yes if your requests are minor and easy for them to accommodate (e.g. asking to have your video off in Zoom meetings or the ability to step out periodically to take medications during the discussion section). Also note that many abled professors are unaware of how difficult the accommodations process can be (e.g., requiring additional expensive testing even for people with existing diagnoses, or taking a long time for all the paperwork to go through), so it helps if you explain why formal accommodations are not an option.

Letting a Professor or TA Know Your Name/Pronouns– Quarter Start:
Dear [Name],

Sincerely,
[Preferred name]

Meeting with a Professor Outside of Their Office Hours:
Dear [Name],

This is [name] from your [course] class. I was hoping to meet with you sometime in the next [time interval] to discuss [topic], but unfortunately, I am busy during your office hours. Do you have any other availability to meet with me? Thank you, [Name]

Confirming that Your Professor/TA is Aware You Have Accommodations
Email version:
Dear [Name],

This is [name] from your [course] class. I was hoping to meet with you sometime in the next [time interval] to discuss [topic], but unfortunately, I am busy during your office hours. Do you have any other availability to meet with me? Thank you, [Name]

Sincerely,
[Preferred name]

In-person version (ask after class or during office hours):

‍“Hi, I requested DRS accommodations for this class, so I just wanted to make sure you got that email?”
[Wait for the instructor to confirm they received it or look through their email. DRS emails sometimes get lost or sent to spam, so you may need to resend them.]
“Okay, did you have any questions about how those work?”
[If they have questions, answer them. If you don’t know the answer or if you’re getting pushback, tell them you’ll email your DRS coordinator and get back to them.]
